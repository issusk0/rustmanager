This is my Rust manager, a task manager built in rust, my first rust program.

How does this works:
is an executable that works with cargo, so you will need to use cargo run to run the program.
The program is a simple task manager that let you kill Processes(some, not all and im lookin why) and also tells you some information of your system like Cpu usage, ram available, total ram, and total core as well with the threads. Every cpu usage per processes is attached to the division of your cores, this means if you see your total cpu usage is 14% and a process is using 50%(for example) this means that, that 50% of the cpu usage is from a single core not all of your cores.
For now, the program let you do a simple stuff like killing a process, yet i dont know why i cant kill other processes and im (like i said) investigating why, yet the functions are simple, for me is important to understand the basis of low level programming, that's why i created this program

Here you can see the diagram(generated by GitDiagram) of my program, it simple, for now.
To Do: -Being able to kill any process you want.
That's all, thank you for you time reading this
